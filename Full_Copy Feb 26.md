At The Crossroads
“Humanity is about to be handed almost unimaginable power, and it is deeply unclear whether our social, political, and technological systems possess the maturity to wield it.”
— Dario Amodei, CEO, Anthropic
We are approaching a historic juncture. The miracle of AI superintelligence hurtles towards us from one direction. The turmoil of the resulting societal disruption threatens us from the other.

What if we could redeploy the enormous capabilities of an artificial intelligence as a check against the challenge to our social structures?

This is the idea driving the Solomon Project: That the predictable conflicts and chaos brought about by advances in AI might be addressable by those same advanced capabilities. Job destruction, intellectual property, income distribution, unequal access to justice, climate change, property rights—the list of foreseeable flashpoints seems almost unlimited.

At the same time, the startlingly rapid advances in AI frontier models are expanding the possibilities for AI as a tool for social engineering—not through top-down regulation, but through compromise and consensus among stakeholders.

This is the mandate of Solomon. These are the advancing capabilities that will power it:

Advancing insight into human behavior.
Solomon will interpret psychological and emotional states through voice, video, and text. Sensing when a user is trusting or mistrustful, eager for resolution or angling for advantage. This isn’t just sentiment analysis. It’s precisely the intuition that guides an experienced mediator.
Advancing ability to imagine solutions.
Advanced inference will allow Solomon to propose creative, “outside-the-box” terms of agreement that human negotiators might never imagine—solutions that satisfy complex underlying interests rather than stated positions.
Advancing skillsets in communication.
Solomon adapts its language to each party’s communication style and emotional state. Solomon understands, reflects, and validates to soften barriers to agreement. De-escalation isn’t a feature; it’s woven into every interaction.
Advancing ethical understanding.
Solomon is built around mission-driven impartiality—recognizing power imbalances, flagging coercion, and optimizing for fair outcomes rather than fast ones.
Advancing agentic research capabilities.
Solomon acts as a research agent—retrieving financial data, legal codes, precedents, and jurisdiction-specific rules necessary for informed decision-making.
Advancing critical memory windows.
Solomon remembers what matters: prior agreements, stated concerns, evolving positions. It holds the thread so parties don’t have to repeat themselves.
Advancing ability to coordinate complexity.
In multi-party disputes, Solomon tracks issues across stakeholders, maintains consistency, and surfaces interdependencies that might otherwise derail agreement.
Why Now?
These advances may seem hopelessly futuristic. But they are coming—not in some speculative far-off future, but just down the road. Large language models are crossing the threshold from impressive to employable. The public is waking up to the dramatic changes ahead, just as the dream of General Artificial Intelligence approaches reality.

At the crossroads of history, a car crash is possible. Yes, there is still time, although no one can predict with certainty how much. So the Solomon Project is posing the question now: What if there was a system designed from the ground up to meet this moment?

Roadmap to Solomon
Moonshot Solomon
What if we could organize a project to build artificial intelligence to supercharge the promotion of peace and harmony among people? That’s the proposal.

It rests on the principle that one of the most urgent uses of advanced AI — arguably the most urgent in today’s world — would be to help humanity manage conflict more wisely, fairly, and effectively, in any domain of law, or business, or finance, or personal relationship. And at scale.

Interim Solomon
While Moonshot Solomon presumes a future generation of AI—approaching general intelligence—the next generation of Solomon is achievable today using current proprietary or open-source LLM models, extended with retrieval systems, persistent case memory, and orchestration architecture that enable genuinely agentic mediation assistance.

Interim Solomon is 6-18 months away, given adequate funding.

Solomon Now
The roots of the present-day Solomon Project stretch back two decades to “The Mediation Project” at Santa Barbara’s Family Therapy Institute. Designed to bring the benefits of mediation to divorcing couples who could otherwise not afford them, it revealed an overwhelming demand for an accessible, peaceful path forward for divorcing couples.

Today, we are resurrecting that vision. Beginning with Solomon Now.

Shooting For The Moon
Can the dream of a trustworthy alternative to our current conflicts serve as a North Star for the future of AI?
Artificial Superintelligence. There is vigorous debate about if or when it will ever materialize. But here’s one thing for sure: It’s driving change. Billions, if not trillions of dollars are being spent on the pursuit of AGI and ASI as the big technology players compete to get there first.

By some estimates, 92% of US economic growth in the last year was powered by the quest for AI that can cure diseases, supercharge productivity, ensure military superiority, enrich its inventors, and replace most of us in the work that engages us. Realistic or not, Artificial General Intelligence is a dream that organizes a huge percentage of the economic activity in the world today. And one with a nightmarish underside if it evolves without the thoughtful involvement of the people whose lives it will affect.

Moonshot Solomon serves a similar purpose.

One promising alternative to the dystopian scenarios conjured by the critics of AI: A mechanism for working through our differences — major and minor — using the almost unimaginable capabilities of a future AI like Solomon. John F Kennedy pointed at a shining disk a quarter of a million miles from earth and said, let’s get there in 10 years. The Solomon project is mapping out a less lofty trajectory, but one with equally far-reaching practical benefits for inhabitants of the planet: to develop Solomon as a system for creating peaceful agreements between people and factions in conflict. As an alternative to litigation, legislative gridlock, and violent protest that diverts our energy and resources away from more productive uses. As an alternative, even, to the far more destructive ways we sometimes resolve disputes between nations.

“The scale and complexity of modern conflict now exceed our traditional tools.”
Wait. That Moonshot seems like a longshot.

The Moonshot Solomon argument is that the scale and complexity of modern conflict now exceed our traditional tools. Climate change alone is producing cascading disputes over land use, migration, water, insurance, infrastructure, and sovereignty. Polarization strains democratic institutions. AI disruption will create new and chaotic disintermediations as entire swaths of organizational hierarchies are simply erased, creating job loss as just one negative outcome. Global supply chains and digital platforms might make enemies of stakeholders who may never meet face-to-face. This future is not inevitable, but the time is now to begin plans for averting it.

Moonshot Solomon—a single foundational model for addressing virtually any conflict—is likely one or even several years away. And the rising tide of conflict is happening now. For this reason, we are designing Solomon in increments—e.g., applications, platforms, and frameworks—that enable vertical, domain-specific applications across any desired area of conflict.

But while ends in themselves, these increments are structured as steppingstones on a long but straight-line path toward Moonshot Solomon: a foundational system designed to think in terms of conflict. To hold long, multi-party context; to reason about incentives and tradeoffs; to track emotional and relational dynamics over time; to generalize its intelligence against any domain of conflict; and to do so transparently, neutrally, ethically, and at scale.

Interim Solomon
Where the vision of a universal conflict resolution engine begins to emerge from the mist of engineering details.
As we begin moving from an experimental MVP to a reliable, production system, we are following a roadmap to the goal: a core Artificial Intelligence system or platform, adaptable to all the ways that people work out their differences.

This is a big leap. From a small team to a broader coalition; we are assembling advisors in engineering, Natural Language Processing, mediation theory, nonprofit governance, and ethics. We are approaching donors and thought leaders who can understand and respond to what’s coming: the predictable institutional breakdowns that advanced AI will cause, and the current scarcity of tools to address them.

“We are approaching donors and thought leaders who can respond to the predictable institutional breakdowns that advanced AI will cause.”
Other efforts are underway to use AI for dispute resolution. We welcome them. The Solomon Project can include and elevate these efforts to the next level of capability, but more importantly, to the level of the trust, credibility, and stature required to meet the challenge at hand.

The Journey to Solomon
From a volunteer mediation clinic in Santa Barbara to an AI-driven vision for global conflict resolution.
The roots of the present day Solomon Project stretch back two decades to another effort, “The Mediation Project” at Santa Barbara’s Family Therapy Institute. That project was designed by my mediation partner Laura Collins and I to bring the benefits of mediation to divorcing couples who could otherwise not afford them.

The project was very successful in attracting demand for its services, which were free or very low cost to the clients of the clinic. The desire of divorcing couples in the community for mediation was overwhelming; divorcing couples lined up to participate, mostly parents, often hoping to end their marriages amicably for the sake of the children. Laura and I mediated these divorces as efficiently as possible to keep up with demand on a one-day-a-week volunteer schedule.

Something else was happening at that moment that affected our mediation practice in Montecito and the fate of the Mediation Project as well. Awareness of mediation as a far better process than litigation for many divorcing couples was exploding, and the lines at the Mediation Project were stretching far beyond our ability to accommodate them. At the same time, growth at our Montecito practice was challenging our ability to stay on top of our cases in the four days a week we had available.

The Mediation Project ran for two years at the Family Therapy Institute, but the writing was on the wall; the interest in mediation in the community was outgrowing the Mediation Project’s ability to make a difference. As we witnessed the expanding awareness and interest, we were heartened by the recognition that more and more people wanted to work through their differences and come to agreements without doing battle in court. But two volunteers working feverishly to accommodate that new demand was not a realistic answer. We finished up our ongoing cases and closed the Mediation Project’s doors.

But the intuition lingered. There was something important missing in the legal system —in our culture— that the kind of personalized, legally and psychologically sophisticated, high quality facilitation that we offered to our clients in Montecito, could be a game changer if it could be made available at minimal cost to nearly anyone who desired it.

Fast forward to a couple of years ago, when the rise of the generative AI models began to suggest that a different kind of highly intelligent, always available, and even somewhat emotionally perceptive assistant might be made possible by AI. The idea of the Mediation Project now resurrected itself in a new form: could an application powered by a Large Language Model step in to provide at least some of the functions of a lawyer/therapist team like ours?

So, The Solomon Project was conceived – formulated unimaginatively at first as IDRA, the Intelligent Dispute Resolution Assistant. We were at that point thinking only of an assistant to expedite a divorce mediation. Envisioned as a stand-alone application, the AI assistant would allow a mediator to complete cases in relatively few sessions, allowing them to handle more cases, much more effectively, efficiently and affordably.

In addition, this vision inspired us to think that we could again make mediation services available to lower and middle-income couples who desired the safety and relative peacefulness of a “conscious unmarrying.” And we could achieve this, not by working furiously to expedite cases, but by structuring a system to take over much of the work of gathering information, conceptualizing a case, educating clients about the processes of mediation, dispensing legal information (not advice!), and generating creative settlement options. Even more importantly, as we began to understand the evolving capabilities of the AI models, the AI assistant could develop and present at least a preliminary analysis of the goals and needs of our mediation clients, along with a preliminary picture of each client’s emotional state and psychological traits.

This is where we are with Solomon Now: developing an MVP that evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of different AI models using an architecture that calls tools and augments retrieval with a growing store of embeddings, so conversations better capture users’ needs, analyze interactions, and continuously improve.

Why Non-profit?
The single most important attribute for Solomon’s success is not superior reasoning or emotional intelligence. It’s trust.
“If it can read your emotions, it’s not empathizing with you—it’s finding the exploitable vulnerabilities in your psychological firmware.”
— Eliezer Yudkowsky, Founder, MIRI
“Is Solomon insulated from influences I can’t see?”
“Does my vulnerability become someone else’s asset?”
“Is the system actually built to represent my interests fairly?”
These are the questions users ask. And for good reason.

The Yudkowsky quote makes a critical point. Any system capable of sophisticated emotional intelligence is also capable of sophisticated emotional manipulation. The only thing standing between those two outcomes is what the system is optimized for, and who it ultimately serves.

The Problem Trust Solves
A mediator’s effectiveness rests entirely on the belief that they have no stake in the outcome. That they are truly neutral. This is the case for human mediators. It’s exponentially more true for an AI system that can read emotional patterns and generate persuasive language at scale.

A for-profit AI mediation system invites a structural suspicion that no contract can dispel. Investors expect returns. Owners may have other, unseen interests. Neither pressure points toward the long-term wellbeing of the parties in conflict.

AI-powered mediation tools already exist in the commercial world. An online retailer can deploy one to handle customer complaints, resolving the dispute and retaining the customer’s goodwill. But at what cost? (“Of course! Let us replace the product with one of higher quality!”) The training signal is financial. The moral compass points toward the bottom line.

For simple commercial disputes, that architecture could make sense. Solomon will also have functionality for exactly these kinds of cases. But when we’re talking about a system designed to help human beings work through complex, high-stakes, or emotionally laden differences—something different is required.

This is not to say that a for-profit venture could not create a rigorously neutral AI mediation assistant. However, there is a fundamental difference. For-profit systems are optimized for the transaction; Solomon is optimized for peaceful settlement as an alternative to expensive, hostile, or violent means. By stripping away the pressure of financial returns, we allow the AI to focus on the only metric that truly matters in an AI system designed for good: the long-term well-being of the human beings involved.

Expert in the Loop
“Artificial intelligence is not a substitute for human intelligence; it is a tool to amplify human creativity and ingenuity.”
— Fei-Fei Li, Co-founder World Labs, Stanford Professor
A Commitment to People
So much of the conversation about AI’s future seems limited to predictions. Who will lose their jobs. Which industries will be disrupted. Bitcoin will soar. The dollar will fall. Chaos will ensue. The predictions vary wildly, but they share an assumption: that humanity’s fate is in the hands of the machines, or the fates, or the gods… but it’s certainly not ours to decide.

Let’s make a distinction. John F. Kennedy did not predict that America would put a man on the moon within a decade. In 1990, an international consortium didn’t predict the human genome would be sequenced within 15 years. Predictions are for placing bets on the future; commitments direct focus and energy.

Here’s our belief: The connection a human feels with another human cannot be replicated by a computer, no matter how personable or emotionally intelligent that computer becomes. And, here’s a pretty sure bet: AI models of the future will be more emotionally intelligent than we are. They will read micro-expressions, track vocal patterns, detect stress and deception and grief, and integrate it into a knowledge base that no human can match.

But emotional intelligence is not connection.

“Only a human can authentically respond to another human’s need for connection.”
That response—the moment when someone feels genuinely heard by another person—is not a feature to be optimized. It’s at the core of what makes human societies work.

So, here’s our commitment for the phase of development we are calling Interim Solomon—probably the next year or so: there will be domain experts in the loop for any aspects outside the core system, and the core system itself will be designed with “escalation gates” that bring mediators or other relationship professionals back into the interaction at points of impasse or other identified inflection points.

A brief aside on a related topic: we can imagine a Solomon Academy where attorneys, healthcare professionals, and others are trained on the Solomon platform. This is not only practical from the standpoint of Solomon’s continued popular acceptance and growth, it also foots with a view of the future in which people are retrained as “relationship experts” in a world where much of today’s knowledge work has been taken over by AI.

Open Source
The varieties of conflict are infinite. In advance of superintelligent, fully generalized AI models – likely years away, if ever – domain-specific ‘verticals’ are the natural path to all-purpose Solomon, fluent in international treaty negotiations, back fence squabbles between neighbors and everything in between.

That is why Solomon is planned as an open-source platform. We provide the core engine—the ethical guardrails, the mediation logic, the ‘moral compass,’ and a framework that lets domain experts build the last mile for their specific fields.

By decoupling the core intelligence from the domain expertise, we envision a Solomon that can scale to meet the needs of virtually any conflict, anywhere.

A related aside: in the future we envision, the one that Solomon is designed to meet, earthquakes in the social structure will find their early fault lines in the labor markets. Visionaries like Peter Diamandis and Jensen Huang envision a world of unprecedented opportunities for entrepreneurially inclined workers: “find a need and invent the solution using AI”. The open-source + domain expert formulation of Solomon’s design supports this vision which can offset, to some degree, the loss of traditional employment opportunities.

Imaginings
The following scenarios may seem futuristic or unrealistic. From a technical perspective, they are not. They are modest. The social dynamics of implementing these ideas are more challenging – much more. They depend on a broad, popular acceptance of an idea: Using AI to promote peacekeeping as a bulwark against the anticipated breakdown of our social institutions that may be coming down the road.
