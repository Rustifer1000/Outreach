# Project Cleanup â€” What to Keep, Merge, or Remove

**Goal:** Reduce file clutter so the repo stays easy to navigate without losing useful docs.

**Done:** CODE_REVIEW.md merged into CODEBASE_REVIEW.md and removed; QUICKSTART.md removed (see outreach-app/README); IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and OUTREACH_APP_CAPABILITIES.md moved to `docs/`.

---

## Root-level files (project root)

| File | Recommendation | Reason |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **README.md** | **Keep** (improve) | Entry point; currently minimal â€” add 1â€“2 sentences + link to `outreach-app/README.md` and `STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md`. |
| **STATUS_AND_NEXT_STEPS.md** | **Keep** | Primary status and next steps; referenced often. |
| **Names** | **Keep** | Source of truth for the contact list. |
| **QUICKSTART.md** | ✅ **Removed** | Overlaps with outreach-app README (how to run). One â€œhow to runâ€ in `outreach-app/README.md` is enough; root README can point there. |
| **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** | ✅ **Moved to docs/** | Long roadmap; now in `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`. |
| **OUTREACH_APP_CAPABILITIES.md** | ✅ **Moved to docs/** | Capability spec; now in `docs/OUTREACH_APP_CAPABILITIES.md`. |
| **CODE_REVIEW.md** | ✅ **Removed** (merged) | Merged into `CODEBASE_REVIEW.md` and deleted. |
| **CODEBASE_REVIEW.md** | **Keep** | Current codebase review (bugs, inefficiencies). |
| **Full_Copy Feb 26.md** | **Remove** or **Move to docs/** | Copy of Solomon project/website text; not code or Names. Either delete or move to `docs/archive/` if you want to keep for reference. |

---

## outreach-app/

| File | Recommendation | Reason |
|------|----------------|--------|
| **README.md** | **Keep** | Main â€œhow to runâ€ + structure + API list. |
| **config.yaml.example** | **Optional keep** | Schedule/config example; app currently uses scheduler defaults and .env. Keep if you plan to add config-driven schedule; otherwise removable. |
| **.env.example** | **Keep** | Needed for API keys and env template. |
| **scripts/seed_sample_mentions.py** | **Keep** | Useful for demo without API key. |
| **data/** (repo root) | **Optional** | `data/contacts.json` and `data/contacts.csv` are generated by `parse_names.py`. Either add to `.gitignore` and regenerate when needed, or keep for quick seed. |

## Do not remove

- Any file under `outreach-app/backend/app/`, `outreach-app/frontend/src/`, or `outreach-app/scripts/` that is part of the running app.
